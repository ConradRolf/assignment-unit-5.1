  - Give the object a 'firstName & (separate) 'lastName' property
  - Give it a boolean 'hasSiblings' property
  - Give it  a numeric 'shoeCount' property
  - Also give it an array 'favThreeFoods'

/* 2. Accessing object properties.
  - Create a variable called fullName 
  - Use the firstName & lastName properties of the object you 
    created above to set its value. 
  - Console.log fullName
*/




/* 3. Nested arrays
  - Console.log your first favorite food
  - Console.log your last favorite food 
*/

/* 4. Change a property of an existing object.
  - Console.log your current shoe count.
  - Guess what?! You just got a new pair of shoes!!!
  - Set your object's shoeCount to be what it was plus 1
  - Console.log your updated shoe count. 
*/


/* 5. Add a new property to an existing object.
  - Add a 'favoriteColor' to your existing object
  - Do this the same way you updated the variable above
  - Cool huh? It works, even though it wasn't there before
  - Console.log your object
